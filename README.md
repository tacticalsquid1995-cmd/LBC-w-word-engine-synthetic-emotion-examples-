The Core Formula
V = w_L × L + w_B × B − w_C × C
This is the kinetic dominance score or net systemic winning power of any action, word, narrative, policy, move, or event — evaluated from the perspective of a given human system (individual, group, institution, culture, etc.) at a specific moment.
Key Elements Explained
Symbol
	Meaning
	What it Represents in Human Systems
	Typical Real-World Flavor / Examples
	Sign / Directionality
	L
	Legitimacy / Life / Agency / "right to act"
	Permission / moral standing / social acceptance / sovereignty in the eyes of others
	Consent, Mandate, Sovereignty, Equity vs Audit, Sanction, Liability
	+ = legitimate / allowed / sovereign
− = illegitimate / challenged / usurped
	B
	Benefit / Directional Gain / Upside captured
	Actual good stuff obtained (power, money, freedom, status, pleasure, security, resources)
	Leverage, Liquidity, Indemnity, Exempt vs Insolvent, Default
	+ = gain / win / profit
− = loss / deprivation
	C
	Cost / Resource Expenditure / Systemic Drag / Price Paid
	What is burned / sacrificed / externalized (time, money, lives, trust, future options, enforcement)
	Liability, Audit, Sanction, Protocol vs Exempt, Indemnity
	+ = high cost / drag / burden
− = cost avoided / offloaded
	w_L
	Weight on Legitimacy
	How much the system currently prioritizes / cares about being seen as legitimate
	High in ideological / religious / institutional systems
	Emergent from collective hardening
	w_B
	Weight on Benefit
	How much raw gain / incentive pull matters to the system
	High in opportunistic / market / survival-driven contexts
	Emergent from collective hardening
	w_C
	Weight on Cost
	How heavily the system feels / accounts for downside / price (often lowest for powerful actors)
	High in risk-averse / traumatized / powerless systems
Low in elite / extractive systems
	Emergent from collective hardening
	V
	Net Kinetic Value / Dominance Score
	How much this move / word / action "wins" or dominates within that system's current weighting
	Higher V → more stable / propagating / spreading in the system
	Positive = expansive / winning
Negative = losing / eroding
	Crucial Insight on Weights (the Breakthrough)
w_L, w_B, w_C are not chosen arbitrarily by one person or designer.
They are the hardened, collective output of thousands/millions of overlapping human systems interacting over time:
* Teaching, media, laws, arguments, wins & losses, economic pressures, social punishments/rewards, historical events, memes, propaganda, peer pressure, court rulings, market signals, family dynamics, online echo chambers, etc.
* Every collision (word vs word, action vs action, narrative vs narrative) challenges and subtly adjusts them.
* The surviving / dominant weight distribution is what the superorganism has converged toward through real, brutal trial-and-error.
→ The formula doesn't invent human values or priorities —
It mathematically reveals the latent scoring function that human systems have already built and continuously update through their collective behavior.
